A file subscription system loosely based on the SIENA publish-subscribe model.  file-subscriber consists of a client and server and makes use of Java RMI for its remote procedure calls for communication between client and server and file transfer.  

Clients can upload and subscribe to files.  Upon subscription to a file, any changes to this file will result in server pushing the newest version to all subscribers.  

Executable jars are available with detailed instructions for usage.  

Refactoring and enhancements coming soon.
